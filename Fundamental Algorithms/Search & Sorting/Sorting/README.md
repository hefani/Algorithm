# Sorting Algorithms

This directory contains both classic and advanced sorting techniques with applied examples in algorithmic problem-solving. Sorting is a core component in many areas of computer science including optimization, graph theory, and computational geometry.

## Implemented Algorithms

| Algorithm       | Time Complexity | Notes |
|----------------|-----------------|-------|
| Bubble Sort     | O(n²)            | Educational use, not efficient |
| Insertion Sort  | O(n²)            | Efficient for nearly-sorted data |
| Selection Sort  | O(n²)            | Simple, but inefficient |
| Merge Sort      | O(n log n)       | Stable, divide-and-conquer |
| Quick Sort      | O(n log n) avg.  | In-place and fast, but unstable |
| Heap Sort       | O(n log n)       | Priority-queue based, rare in contests |
